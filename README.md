# About

The Ceasoning (pronounced, "seasoning") project provides syntactic sugar for
common C tasks. It uses the "csalt" prefix (pronounced "seasalt") and uses
the csalt directory for include files.

# Goals

The goals of Ceasoning are:
- to avoid acquiring a resource without releasing it;
- to provide tools for building complex relationships
  between resources easily.

The current focus is on providing non-blocking interfaces, for the sake of
allowing applications to report progress.
